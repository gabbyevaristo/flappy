# Flappy Bird Re-Creation

This is a re-creation of Flappy Bird, built fully with PyGame. Also implemented is an online two-player mode.

To run the game, clone the repository and run ``` python run_game.py ```. This allows you to play the single player mode. For two player mode, the server must be turned on and activated.
